# Basic Tip Calculator
This is a simple Javascript tip calculator - It was a fun little project to do as I continue to hone my skills as a javascript developer. I enjoy working with html and css, but find myself creating mini projects like this with javascript, every other day.
I got inspiration for the layout off some goole images but I just starting out with a clean slate and went from there. Any feedback is welcome!üòÅ
